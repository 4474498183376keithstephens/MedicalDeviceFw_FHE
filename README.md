# MedicalDeviceFw_FHE

A secure firmware platform for critical medical devices, leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to ensure that all device firmware and remote commands are encrypted, verified, and resistant to malicious attacks. This system is designed to protect patient safety while enabling secure remote maintenance and updates.

## Project Overview

Medical devices like ventilators, patient monitors, and infusion pumps rely on firmware for core functionality. Compromised firmware or unauthorized commands can pose life-threatening risks. Traditional security mechanisms, while useful, often leave gaps:

* Firmware updates can be intercepted or tampered with during transmission
* Remote commands may be executed without proper verification
* Centralized systems can be compromised, exposing patient-critical devices

MedicalDeviceFw_FHE addresses these issues using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**:

* **Encrypted Firmware Updates:** Device firmware is encrypted at all stages, ensuring only the intended device can decrypt and execute it
* **Encrypted Command Verification:** Remote instructions are encrypted and verified using FHE, allowing computations to happen directly on encrypted data
* **Tamper-Proof Operations:** Unauthorized modifications are detected and blocked before they can affect device functionality

FHE is central to this platform because it allows sensitive computations on encrypted data without exposing the underlying firmware or command content, ensuring end-to-end confidentiality and integrity.

## Key Features

### Firmware Security

* **Encrypted Updates:** Firmware packages are encrypted before distribution
* **Integrity Verification:** Updates are validated against cryptographic checksums before execution
* **Version Control:** Devices track update history securely

### Secure Remote Commands

* **FHE-Based Verification:** Commands can be validated while encrypted, preventing exposure of sensitive operations
* **Encrypted Execution:** Commands are executed without decrypting, reducing attack surfaces
* **Audit Logging:** Encrypted logs ensure tamper-proof traceability

### Device Management

* **Centralized Management, Securely:** Administrators can manage devices without accessing sensitive firmware data
* **Device Status Monitoring:** Devices report health metrics in encrypted form
* **Secure Maintenance:** Remote troubleshooting and maintenance can be performed without compromising security

### Safety & Compliance

* **Patient Safety First:** Security mechanisms prevent unauthorized control of critical devices
* **Regulatory Alignment:** Supports compliance with medical device security standards
* **End-to-End Encryption:** Data is protected in transit and at rest
